# ATTNode v3 Firmware (WiP)

THIS IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS AND VERY MUCH EXPERIMENTAL!

This is the Work in Progress Repository for ATTNode v3 compatible firmware. 

As there is no PlatformIO Support for the ATTiny3216 yet, it is (for now) developed using Arduino IDE and the [MegaTinyCore](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/megaTinyCore)

Programming is done using a [MicroUPDI Programmer](https://github.com/MCUdude/microUPDI) - for other pogramming variants see the MegaTinyCore documentation.
